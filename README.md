flipping, kernel-size change ,Image-filtering is a process used in computer vision for image filtering and feature extraction. The flipping operation involves reversing the order of elements in a kernel or filter matrix. The kernel size refers to the dimensions of the kernel matrix, which is typically a small square matrix.

Image filtering is performed by convolving the kernel matrix with the input image. Each element of the kernel is multiplied with the corresponding pixel value in the image, and the results are summed to obtain a new pixel value in the output image. This operation is repeated for every pixel in the image, resulting in a filtered image.

The kernel size affects the extent of the neighborhood considered for filtering. A larger kernel size includes more surrounding pixels in the computation, leading to a smoother or more blurred output. Conversely, a smaller kernel size focuses on a smaller region, resulting in sharper or more localized filtering effects.

By applying different kernel matrices and adjusting the kernel size, various image filtering operations can be performed, such as blurring, sharpening, edge detection, and feature extraction. These operations are fundamental in image processing and computer vision tasks, enabling the enhancement and analysis of digital images for various applications.
